# BEPUphysics

BEPUphysics is a pure C# 3D physics library by [BEPU](http://bepuphysics.com). It's fast and has a bunch of cool features like constraints, terrain, static and instanced meshes, continuous collision detection, custom collision rules, vehicles, easy multithreading, yadda yadda yadda.

Stuff you'll find in this repository:

1. [BEPUphysics](BEPUphysics), the physics simulation library
2. [BEPUik](BEPUik), the simulation-based inverse kinematics solver library
3. [BEPUphysicsDemos](BEPUphysicsDemos), the demonstration and test application for the above, along with its [debug renderer](BEPUphysicsDrawer).
4. [Documentation](Documentation/Documentation.md) and supplemental isolated demo applications.

Just starting out? Check out the [Getting Started](Documentation/GettingStarted.md) tutorial in the documentation section.

Check the [documentation page](Documentation/Documentation.md) for some deeper dives, isolated demos, and links to additional resources.

The library uses its own math libraries for cross platform development. The demo applications rely on [monogame](http://www.monogame.net/).

This repository contains the v1.X.X implementation of BEPUphysics that used to be hosted on [codeplex](https://bepuphysics.codeplex.com/). In the future, there will be another repository for the new v2.X.X implementation, which is pretty much a complete rewrite. Check out the [scratchpad repository](https://github.com/RossNordby/scratchpad) for some early bits and pieces.
